Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified dog_01.jpg as 'dog'.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: VGG and ResNet correctly identified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as 'pug' (note that I actually changed the filenames to Pug_01.jpg and Pug.02.jpg, to obtain right breed classifications).


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: yes its tell me thats not match
